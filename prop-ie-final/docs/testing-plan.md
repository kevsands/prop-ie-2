# Prop.ie Platform Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Prop.ie platform to ensure all components function correctly before production launch.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Frontend Components**: Test individual React components in isolation
- **Backend Services**: Test individual controllers, models, and utility functions
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library

### 2. Integration Testing
- **API Endpoints**: Test all backend API endpoints
- **Database Interactions**: Test database operations
- **Tools**: Supertest, MongoDB Memory Server

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- **User Flows**: Test complete user journeys
- **Tools**: Cypress

- Staging: Production-like environment with anonymized data
- Production: Live environment with real data

## Test Schedule
- Unit and integration tests: Run on every commit
- End-to-end tests: Run on pull requests to main branches
- Manual testing: Performed before each release

## Acceptance Criteria
- All automated tests pass
- No critical or high-severity bugs
- Performance meets defined benchmarks
- Accessibility compliance verified
- Security vulnerabilities addressed
