# Prop.ie Handover Instructions

## Overview

This document provides instructions for taking ownership of the enhanced Prop.ie platform. It covers how to access the codebase, set up the development environment, and manage the production deployment.

## Repository Access

1. **GitHub Repository**
   - The complete codebase is available at: https://github.com/kevsands/prop-ie
   - Ensure you have appropriate access permissions (admin rights recommended)
   - Clone the repository using: `git clone https://github.com/kevsands/prop-ie.git`

2. **Branch Structure**
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `develop`: Development branch for new features
   - Feature branches should follow the pattern: `feature/feature-name`

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js 18.x or higher
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - MongoDB (local or containerized)
   - Git

2. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd prop-ie/frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.development.example .env.development
   # Edit .env.development with your local settings
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd prop-ie/backend
   npm install
   cp .env.development.example .env.development
   # Edit .env.development with your local settings
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Docker Development Environment**
   ```bash
   cd prop-ie
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

## Testing

1. **Running Tests**
   - Frontend tests: `cd frontend && npm test`
   - Backend tests: `cd backend && npm test`
   - End-to-end tests: `cd frontend && npm run test:e2e`

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Tests run automatically on pull requests and merges to main/develop
   - View test results in the GitHub Actions tab

## Deployment Management

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Automated via GitHub Actions when changes are merged to main
   - Manual deployment: `./deploy.sh` from the project root

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Production environment variables are stored in:
     - Frontend: `.env.production`
     - Backend: `.env.production`
   - Sensitive values should be managed through secure environment variable storage

3. **Monitoring**
   - Application logs are stored in `/var/log/prop-ie/`
   - Database backups are stored in `/backup/`
   - Set up monitoring alerts for critical errors

## Domain and SSL

1. **Domain Management**
   - The domain prop.ie should be configured to point to your production server
   - DNS records should be updated if the hosting infrastructure changes

2. **SSL Certificates**
   - SSL certificates are managed through Let's Encrypt
   - Auto-renewal is configured, but monitor expiration dates

## Regular Maintenance

1. **Database Backups**
   - Daily automated backups are configured
   - Verify backup integrity weekly
   - Store offsite backups monthly

2. **Security Updates**
   - Regularly update dependencies: `npm audit fix`
   - Apply server security patches monthly
   - Conduct security audits quarterly

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor server resource usage
   - Review application performance metrics
   - Optimize database queries as needed

## Documentation

All project documentation is available in the `/docs` directory:

- `technical-documentation.md`: Technical architecture and components
- `deployment-guide.md`: Detailed deployment instructions
- `testing-plan.md`: Testing strategy and procedures
- `user-guide.md`: End-user documentation
- `project-summary.md`: Project overview and achievements

## Support and Handover

1. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Schedule a handover meeting to walk through the codebase
   - Review the technical documentation together
   - Discuss any specific implementation details or challenges

2. **Support Period**
   - Initial support period: 30 days from handover
   - Support includes bug fixes and clarification of implementation details
   - Additional development work or feature enhancements will require a new agreement

3. **Contact Information**
   - For technical support during the handover period, contact:
     - Email: support@prop.ie
     - Phone: +353 (0)1 234 5678

## Future Development

Refer to the recommendations in the project summary document for suggested future enhancements. The modular architecture of the platform allows for easy extension and addition of new features.
